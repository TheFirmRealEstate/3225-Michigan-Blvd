        <div class="accordion-content p-5 bg-sky-50 text-slate-800 rounded-b-md shadow-inner">
          <p class="mb-4">You may be wondering what you’re looking at. This fireplace isn’t made of hand-painted or glazed ceramic tiles — it’s lithographic printing on stone, built right into the architecture of the home. The names you see weren’t scrawled in ink and fired in a kiln; they were transferred through a meticulous printing process, the same kind that gave Racine its world-class reputation for fine lithography.</p>
          <p>From the day this house was built, the hearth stood like a printed page in three dimensions — part art, part industry, part declaration.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content p-5 bg-sky-50 text-slate-800 rounded-b-md shadow-inner">
          <p class="mb-4">In the early 20th century, Racine was one of the great printing capitals of America. Western Printing & Lithographing Co., just blocks away, produced everything from classic children’s books to art prints and decorative panels.</p>
          <p>This fireplace belongs to that legacy. The same techniques used to print storybooks, maps, and advertisements were applied here to stone — proof that Western’s craftsmen didn’t just print on paper. They experimented with surfaces, processes, and permanence.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content p-5 bg-sky-50 text-slate-800 rounded-b-md shadow-inner">
          <p class="mb-4">Every signature surrounding the hearth was printed, not handwritten directly on the tile. It’s a composition of many hands — perhaps employees, artists, and family members of Western Printing. Names like <em>Voigt, Homburg, Sheets, Anderson,</em> and <em>Kraus</em> appear — some tied to Western Printing’s early leadership, others to Racine’s artistic and industrial community.</p>
          <p>Their signatures overlap and swirl across the tiles, like the credits of a film etched into the very heart of a home.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content p-5 bg-sky-50 text-slate-800 rounded-b-md shadow-inner">
          <p class="mb-4">Why a fireplace? Because it’s where warmth and permanence meet — the perfect canvas for a city built on making things that last. This wasn’t a private flourish or hidden time capsule. It was always meant to be seen. The homeowners — and perhaps Western Printing itself — wanted to make a statement: that craftsmanship, design, and pride belong not just in galleries or books, but in everyday life.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content p-5 bg-sky-50 text-slate-800 rounded-b-md shadow-inner">
          <p class="mb-4">Lithographic transfer on stone or tile required extraordinary precision. Artists wrote in ink on a flat litho plate, which was then chemically treated and pressed onto the surface. It’s the same principle behind Western’s printed books — only here, it’s architectural. The subtle variations, the natural texture of the tiles, and the clarity of the signatures all suggest this was more than decoration: it was a demonstration of mastery, perhaps even a showpiece for clients or visiting designers.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content p-5 bg-sky-50 text-slate-800 rounded-b-md shadow-inner">
          <p class="mb-4">Nearly a century later, this fireplace still speaks to the spirit of the city that made it — inventive, collaborative, proud. It’s not just a record of names. It’s a printed artifact — a physical link between Racine’s industrial innovation and its artistic soul.</p>
          <p>In its quiet way, it’s saying what every printer, craftsman, and builder once believed: that good work deserves to be signed, and beautiful work deserves to endure.</p>
