      <div class="sub">Exploring the Art Deco heritage, architectural innovation, and enduring legacy of Racine’s lakefront landmark.</div>

    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction – A Landmark on Racine’s Lakefront</h2>
      <p>Perched above the shoreline of Lake Michigan, 3225 Michigan Blvd stands as one of Racine’s most architecturally distinctive private residences. Completed in the early 1930s, the home is a rare example of high-style Art Deco residential design in southeastern Wisconsin. With its streamlined geometry, horizontal emphasis, and decorative masonry, it reflects both the optimism and precision of an era fascinated with progress and modernity.</p>
      <p>At a time when Racine’s economy was flourishing thanks to its industrial titans — J.I. Case, Western Publishing, and Modine — homes like this were symbols of achievement and creative ambition. 3225 Michigan Blvd was more than a home; it was a statement about what it meant to live beautifully in an age of innovation.</p>

      <h2>The Architect – Edwin J. Krause and Modernism in the Midwest</h2>
      <p>The architect, <strong>Edwin J. Krause</strong>, was among the most forward-thinking designers in Racine and Milwaukee during the interwar years. His work bridges the gap between the ornamental exuberance of Art Deco and the sleek efficiency of the emerging Moderne style. Krause’s architectural vocabulary emphasized geometric motifs, smooth surfaces, and the integration of technology and craftsmanship — qualities clearly on display in the Michigan Blvd home.</p>
      <p>Like many Midwestern modernists, Krause drew inspiration from European movements such as Bauhaus, merging beauty with utility. In this home, he achieved a timeless composition: elegant yet durable, artistic yet livable.</p>

    <section id="commission">
      <h2>The Commission – Elmer Voigt and Western Publishing’s Influence</h2>
      <p>The home’s original owner, <strong>Elmer Voigt</strong>, was a senior executive at <strong>Western Printing and Lithographing Company</strong> — later known worldwide for publishing <em>Little Golden Books</em>. Western was a cornerstone of Racine’s creative economy, merging artistry and industrial printing on a massive scale.</p>
      <p>Voigt’s personal connection to printing likely inspired the home’s most unique feature — printed or lithographically decorated stone tiles in the lower level. These tiles may have been an early experiment applying Western’s lithographic techniques to architectural materials, turning the home itself into a living showcase of innovation.</p>

      <h2>Architectural Features and Innovations</h2>
      <p>The residence combines form and function in a way that feels remarkably contemporary. The exterior’s symmetrical façade is softened by rounded corners and horizontal banding that echo the streamlined designs of ships and automobiles — popular motifs in the Art Deco era. Inside, the open plan encourages light, flow, and comfort, showing how progressive the home was for its time.</p>
      <p>Custom cabinetry, ornamental metalwork, and advanced mechanical systems reflect both craftsmanship and innovation. From the curved staircase to the fireplace detailing, every element was carefully designed to balance grace and engineering precision.</p>

    <section id="context">
      <h2>Context – Racine’s Golden Age of Industry and Design</h2>
      <p>In the 1930s, Racine was a city of invention. Industrial leaders like Western Publishing, J.I. Case, and Modine Manufacturing shaped not just local industry but also local identity. Executives and designers alike believed that good design represented good citizenship — that beauty, efficiency, and progress were civic values.</p>
      <p>Within this context, 3225 Michigan Blvd stands as a residential echo of Racine’s industrial landmarks, such as Frank Lloyd Wright’s <em>Wingspread</em> and the <em>SC Johnson Administration Building</em>. It captures the city’s drive to innovate — on factory floors and in living rooms alike.</p>

The printed tiles, glass block, and geometric flourishes continue to tell a story of ingenuity and artistry that began nearly a century ago.</p>
      <p>As both a home and a work of art, it stands as a tribute to Racine’s enduring spirit — where creativity, craftsmanship, and industry meet in timeless harmony.</p>
